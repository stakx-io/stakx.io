stakx is a brand new static website generator inspired by the several out there and builds upon them to introduce a different and more organized way of doing things. This website serves to be a detailed guide on how to build your website with stakx. If you're familiar with Jekyll, you'll find a lot of similarities with the functionality and concepts.

## Why use PHP?

stakx was written in PHP for a number of reasons. There is an extremely powerful templating engine written in PHP called [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/), which far surpasses Liquid for those coming from a Jekyll background. For developers accustomed to LAMP environments, stakx will be able to run without having to bother ensuring your host is using the correct version of Ruby.

## So, why stakx?

There is the [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io/) project but it differs a lot from a typical Jekyll setup and requires a lot of configuration and setup just to build a single website.

stakx is distributed as a single executable with absolutely no need for a package manager (e.g. Composer or Bundler) to fetch all its dependencies.
